“Pawsitive Futures” is a web-based pet adoption platform that streamlines the adoption process for three user roles: Admin, Shelter, and User. Admins manage shelter and user accounts, ensuring platform security. Shelters post pet listings, handle adoption applications, and update pet statuses, playing a central role in the adoption process. Users browse pets, submit applications, and track their status through a user-friendly interface. The platform uses modern web technologies to provide an efficient, role-based system that enhances the adoption experience and supports animal welfare.
